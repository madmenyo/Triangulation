# Triangulation
Playing with Delaunay Triangles in LibGDX

A study of Delaunay triangulation and common alghorithms used on graphs. Using the LibGDX framework to visualize the steps involved. I want to extend this in with creating minimal spanning tree's on the Delaunay graph and add a pathfinding system to get from Node A to Node B. I am doing this in my current game to create procedural maps and shall share what I have learned after completion.
